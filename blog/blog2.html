      Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa. From a young age, 
      he showed a deep interest in technology and innovation. By the age of 12, Musk had 
      already created and sold his first video game, <em>Blastar</em>.

    <h2>Founding Zip2 and PayPal</h2>
    <p>
      After moving to the United States, Musk co-founded <strong>Zip2</strong>, a company that provided 
      business directories and maps to newspapers. It was sold to Compaq in 1999 for nearly $300 million. 
      Shortly after, he co-founded <strong>X.com</strong>, an online payment company that would eventually become <strong>PayPal</strong>. 
      PayPal was later acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock.

      In 2002, Musk founded <strong>SpaceX</strong> with the goal of making space travel more affordable and eventually enabling 
      human life on Mars. Despite multiple failures in its early years, SpaceX became the first privately 
      funded company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station.

      Musk also became the CEO of <strong>Tesla Motors</strong> in 2008, leading the company to revolutionize the electric 
      vehicle industry. Under his leadership, Tesla became one of the most valuable car companies in the world.

    <h2>Other Ventures and Innovations</h2>

      Beyond Tesla and SpaceX, Musk founded or supported companies like <strong>Neuralink</strong> (developing brain–computer 
      interfaces), <strong>The Boring Company</strong> (tunneling and infrastructure), and <strong>SolarCity</strong> (solar energy solutions).
